# Commerce website for Web50


## To-Do List

1. Create error/warning if incorrect data has been input to create_listing page, resulting in no entry to db

2. Save categories in models.py instead of a line in top of views.py. This should also fix category-unusuality in the create_listing function

3. Remove quotationmarks from User models referring to listings

4. Make popups on:
    - New listing created
    - Bid succesfully made
    - Bid was unsuccessful due to being too low

5. Fix everything to do with authetication on the listing page
